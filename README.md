This is README of project named "finalCapstone"
This project demonstrate how to find semantic similarity by NLP
The following describes what purpose of each python source: 
- example.py run the walk-through example of semantic similarity (NLP)
- semantic.py run the similarities between cat, monkey and banana
- watch_next.py create the function to return which movies a user would watch next if they have watched "Planet Hulk"
- movies.txt are the list of movies that a user can watch
Every python file can run independently and check heading of each source if additional installation is required.
